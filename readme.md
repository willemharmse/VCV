This will be the layout of my virtual CV on the webpage hosted by GitHub.

I am using a one-page layout as it is simpler and will not require the user to navigate through multiple pages. It also ensures that mobile users have an overall better experience using my webpage.

The idea behind the buttons that float on the site is:
    Top button: This helps the user navigate to the top more easily without the need to scroll manually.
    Get CV button: This allows viewers of my webpage to download the CV if they decide to.

My site also includes a preview of my CV through clickable buttons that can be used to see the relevant information.

Lastly, my page includes a contact information section that can be used to reach out to me. It includes links to all my social media accounts.
